            <p>100SMILES Dental Care is a dental clinic that provides a wide variety of services to meet different
               dental needs.
               We do not just focus on treating problems — We also work on preventing them and improving the
               overall look of your smile.
               Our services include routine check-ups, professional cleanings, dental implants, orthodontics (like
               braces), cosmetic dentistry, and even emergency treatments.
            </p>

               The clinic's dentists are skilled in diagnosing and treating all kinds of dental issues, including
               performing surgeries when needed. They also believe that educating patients is just as important as
               treatment — teaching people about good oral hygiene, healthy eating habits, and how to care for
               their teeth properly.</p>
            </div><div class="tablet-desktop">
            <p> Above all, 100SMILES Dental Care aims to give every patient — whether a child, adult, or senior —
               the best possible care in a friendly and professional environment. Their goal is to make sure every
               patient feels informed, comfortable, and confident about their dental health.
